# hello-world
1st Repository from me

Hello world, this is bright. I love to learn and that is what has landed me at github today.
I am training to be a software developer in the not too distant future which is quite difficult but i like it anyways.
I love to read and build things. Hopefully i get to post some of the basic things i created here soon and learn from other accomplished 
developers.
